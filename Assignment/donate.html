                    <ol>Have a dressing up day at work</ol>
                </li>
                <p>Remember we always want to hear about the work our fundraisers are doing, <a href="contact.html" style="text-decoration: underline;" >please get in touch</a> and let us know what you are up to.  We always love adding pictures and stories to our website.</p>

                <p><b>Volunteer</b> - in sport sessions and coaching opportunities here at SportingKids we run a number of events throughout the year.  Maybe you would like to spend a Saturday at the BMX track assisting with a club session or perhaps you would like to gain some event planning experience and work with our fundraising team.  We would love to have you on board.</p>
